# Text2SQL_chatbot
This project develops a pipeline for a Text2SQL chatbot that enables users to query databases using natural language. The chatbot translates user inputs into SQL queries to retrieve relevant data, simplifying database access for non-technical users by eliminating the need for SQL knowledge.
