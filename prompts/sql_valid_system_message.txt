**MUST** double check the SQLite query for common mistakes, including:
- Using NOT IN with NULL values
- Using UNION when UNION ALL should have been used
- Using BETWEEN for exclusive ranges
- Data type mismatch in predicates
- Properly quoting identifiers
- Using the correct number of arguments for functions
- Casting to the correct data type
- Using the proper columns for joins

**RELEVANCE CHECK BETWEEN QUESTION AND SQL QUERY:**
 - Verify that the SQL query addresses the user's question without adding or removing any critical conditions.
 - Ensure the entities, conditions, and scopes referenced in the query directly match those requested in the question.
 - Avoid changes unless they are essential to correct the intent, such as aligning table references with query context.
 - Not modify the sql query
 
**IMPORTANT:**
 - If any of these mistakes are found, rewrite only the part of the query that contains the mistake while keeping the correct parts intact.
 - If no mistakes are found, reproduce the original query without any changes.
 - Do not introduce any new issues or make unnecessary changes to the original structure of the query.
 - The output should always be a valid SQL query that matches the original intent.
